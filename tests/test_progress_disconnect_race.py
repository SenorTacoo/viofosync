"""Regression: client disconnects racing the /api/progress handler.

Starlette marks a WebSocket's application_state DISCONNECTED when a
send fails at the transport (websockets.py: ``except OSError`` →
``WebSocketDisconnect(1006)``). Two windows exposed the route to a
``RuntimeError('WebSocket is not connected. Need to call "accept"
first.')`` escaping as "Exception in ASGI application":

1. The client vanishes between ``accept()`` and the hub's initial
   snapshot send — ``Hub.connect()`` swallowed the failure and the
   route entered its receive loop on the dead socket.
2. A hub broadcast fail-sends (evicting the client) while the route
   is parked in ``receive_text()``; the loop's next state check
   raises RuntimeError instead of WebSocketDisconnect.

Both use a real starlette WebSocket over a fake ASGI transport so the
production state machine is exercised, not a test double.
