"""The active-recording overage deferral must NOT burn a download attempt.

When download_file detects the file is still growing (streamed bytes exceed the
expected size) it raises DownloadDeferred; the sync worker must treat that like
a cancellation — return the item to pending with its attempt refunded — so a
clip the completeness guard missed can never exhaust max_attempts and get stuck
permanently 'failed'."""
