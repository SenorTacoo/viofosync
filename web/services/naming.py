"""Camera facade for the web layer + export filename derivation.

Pure functions — no DB or HTTP. Two roles:

1. The web app's view of the camera registry
   (viofosync_lib/cameras.py): re-exports plus the derived
   per-camera export job types (``join_<channel>``, ``pip``/
   ``pip_<channel>``) with their letter/partner/main tables, and
   the timeline channel order/labels.

2. Download filenames for joined/PiP exports: ``build_basename``
   turns a set of clips plus a camera label into a stem like
   ``2024-03-15_1430-1502_front_4clips``; ``export_download_name``
   maps an export job type to a label and appends ``.mp4``,
   falling back to the legacy ``viofosync_export_{id}.mp4`` when
   the source clips are gone (retention) or the type is unknown.
   (Original, un-joined clips keep their dashcam basenames — they
   don't go through this module.) Timestamps are unix seconds
   formatted in local time, matching how the archive UI renders
   clip times (web/routers/archive.py).
