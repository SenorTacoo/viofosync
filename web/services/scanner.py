"""Archive scanner — walks $RECORDINGS and indexes clips.

Uses :func:`viofosync_lib.get_downloaded_recordings` so the
listing shares the CLI's filename regex. Each clip is upserted
into ``clip_index`` with derived metadata (camera, sequence,
event type, GPX presence).

The walk is intentionally bounded to the grouping-folder depth
the CLI produces — a full ``os.walk`` would descend into the
``.thumbs`` and ``.exports`` caches.

Event type is a heuristic from the filename + queue source_dir.
The XML listing's ATTR byte is more authoritative but is only
available at download time.
