"""WebSocket endpoint streaming live download + export events.

Authentication: the handshake's ``Cookie`` header is checked
for a valid session token, and a browser-sent ``Origin`` must
match the request host — browsers attach cookies to
cross-origin WS handshakes and WS is exempt from same-origin
fetch rules, so without this check any page the logged-in
admin visits could read the event stream. Requests without an
Origin header (curl, Home Assistant, scripts) are gated by
auth alone.
